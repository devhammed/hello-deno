# hello-deno

My first project using Deno runtime.

## Usage

- Install Deno for your platform [here](https://deno.land)
- Then run `deno run --allow-net --allow-env server.ts`
- Visit the website at [localhost:3000](https://localhost:3000)
- Enjoy!

## Notes

You can customize the port and hostname the server will be listening on with `PORT` and `HOST` environment variables respectively.
